However we failed to put our message deeply, or some of results were quite meaningful but we fail to spread out our messages or our acts to outside community. How can we extend civic tech to civic organizations outside community?</p><p>In South Korea. most of civic organizations(NPO, NGO, and the media) are interested in data and data journalism, but they don’t have capacity to treat the data and data journalism. Event they don’t have any developers to maintain their own website. Because of that, after they constructed huge and valuable data to make stories for years, the data has been hidden somewhere on their PCs in not-machine-readable formats.</p><p>From this year, we’re developing a Data Specialists Working Group composed of civic hackers; technitians, designers, and data experts. This group will be in partnerships with NPO, NGO, and the media for data journalism projects. CodeNamu civic technitians and our partners composed of journalists and activits will make synergy to make those data open and to make various data journalism projects between CodeNamu’s civic tech and partners’ insight or messages. We hope that we’re going to introduce and discuss about the way to extend civic tech to outside civic tech community.</p>"

It’s essential part of building engagement in modern society. But we – citizens – need and often demand something more. We are ready to take responsibility for the place we live and work. We do care about the quality of the life we live in our cities. We need to be treated as partner by our government.</p><p>At first Personal Democracy Forum in Poland in 2013, Ellen Miller from Sunlight Fundation said that \"government is as strong as citizens informed\".

Is it possible to empower citizens and allow them to manage our cities (not only from time to time, but daily)?

Hundreds of thousands of people participate at this process creating a collective intelligence that finally faced top leaders at Podemos.

I'm going to share a story about a much longer game, where the payoff is just starting to happen now, five years later.</p><p>This will be a story of how organizations around the world built a software stack for legislative monitoring. It starts with a vision shared in Warsaw in 2011. In 2012, work on a standard data interchange format begins, which will tie the stack together. Two organizations start authoring backend data management tools in 2013 using this format. In 2014, the first user-facing tools appear at the top of this stack. And in 2015, governments begin adopting the data standard, as more user-facing tools spread.</p><p>This journey will visit many organizations and projects around the world, from mySociety to OpenAustralia to Sunlight, and from PopIt to Councilmatic to Represent, among others. We're five years into this journey, and there's still more ground to cover for at least as many more years before the basic problems in legislative monitoring that we're solving can be taken for granted.</p><p>This talk ties into the fork-merge theme.

            "abstract": "<p>From the point of view of urban governance, Nepal’s towns and cities have expanded rapidly. The Kathmandu Valley has grown especially rapidly – from a population of about 1.6 million in 2001 to a population of about 2.5 million in 2011. This unexpected and unplanned growth has proven a challenge to many aspects of city life. The systems by which residents communicate, organize themselves, and negotiate with each other and the state has altered. When the intention is to radically reform the system, large amounts of money and manpower must be gathered. At the same time, there are few initiatives as well who take the opposite approach. New belief is that limited resources and focus also be sufficient in order to begin to dent the system as much as possible on basis of collaborations and crowdsourcing even though there are no single and known solutions to the complex issues of urban governance and no guarantee that any given intervention will succeed.</p><p>GalliGalli is an initiative based in Kathmandu which gathers, packages, and disseminates information using new technologies for the civilians to make their lives easier by providing information on processes – formal and informal – for accessing government services. GalliGalli works both on-the-ground and online. GalliGalli’s core focus is to use open source approach to enable people to take part in social change by facilitating mass participation. This paper would like to explain how these processes and practices are developed and experimented by GalliGalli  using technologies to promote government transparency and attract civic participation through crowdsourcing on different topics which aims to bridge citizen-state gap into daily governance. </p><p>This paper will focus on ‘Nalibeli’ platform developed in Kathmandu to support state-citizens interaction as service providers-and-receivers. For example, when people want to start a business or non-profit, they have to register at the concerned government offices. Subsequently, there are periodic obligations such as submitting annual reports, filing tax returns, and calling general meeting. ‘Nalibeli’ plays a role of consultant to equip people with all the necessary information to fulfill these obligations. Not only through online open technology, a group of young volunteers also visit the concerned offices and guide people through each of the steps if they require support. ‘Nalibeli’ also perform Service Delivery Mapping which is an on-the-ground survey, research, and mapping initiative to document the nature of day-to-day problems faced by citizens, creating a listing of service providers by locality, understand the manner in which neighbourhoods organize. Most of these information are made available through an open platform (<a href='www.nalibeli.org'>www.nalibeli.org</a>) with step-by-step information on how to access a range of government services.  The platform runs on information shared by thousands of individual users. The usefulness of the platform increases as the number of active users grow. The platform has information in Nepali and English. This paper aims to unpack these complex realities of running open source approach to facilitate state-citizens relationship focusing on the ‘Nalibeli’ platform developed by GalliGalli initiative.</p>"

LocalWiki is using OSM for visualizing geographic objects, e.g., a restaurant, a plaza, or an old tree. However, the geographic objects visualized on LocalWiki aren’t interlinked to OSM. The users of LocalWiki actually draw the geographic objects but don’t take geographic objects from OSM. In addition, the geographic objects drawn on LocalWiki aren’t stored in OSM. This project undertakes the improvement of LocalWiki for working together with OSM. The improved LocalWiki will provide a function that users can directly select geographic objects form OSM. As a result, a geographic object textually described LocalWiki can be correspondingly linked to its geographic information on OSM.</p><p>In recent years, OSM often plays an important role in disaster relief. This is because OSM can provide users to map the areas influenced by disaster. In contrast, OSM also allows mappers to contribute the geographic objects associated with disasters such as shelters before a disaster happens. The mapping is a kind of disaster preparedness that is beneficial for mitigating the impact of a coming disaster. The improved LocalWiki will be used for citizens to provide disaster preparedness information and map the information in community level.</p>"

This friction stops people from creating, sharing, collaborating, and using data - especially among distributed communities. Open Knowledge, in working with researchers and government for more than a decade on these issues, have identified a specific area where this friction can be addressed: the technical process of preparing and sharing data. Toward this end, we are developing a lightweight specification and associated tooling for “packaging” data and transporting it easily and efficiently. The approach is titled “Data Package” because our work has a close analogy with “containerization” in shipping and “packaging” in software. Our goal is to make it easy for data go from one person’s tool (e.g. Excel) to another person’s tool as quickly and as easily as possible.</p><p>Through this approach, we think we can reduce friction enough to revolutionize how the open data ecosystem operates with massively improved data quality, utilization and sharing.</p>"

We support 5 of the most popular programming languages so you can write your scraper in the language you know and love. Your scraper runs in the cloud to your schedule and emails you if there are any problems. You can then download your data in CSV or even do SQL queries using the simple API.</p><p>In this talk I will introduce morph.io and show you how everything works behind the scenes. We will then explore some of the thousands of existing scrapers and I'll show you how you can access the tens of millions of rows of data they've already collected.

However we failed to put our message deeply, or some of results were quite meaningful but we fail to spread out our messages or our acts to outside community. How can we extend civic tech to civic organizations outside community?</p><p>In South Korea. most of civic organizations(NPO, NGO, and the media) are interested in data and data journalism, but they don’t have capacity to treat the data and data journalism. Event they don’t have any developers to maintain their own website. Because of that, after they constructed huge and valuable data to make stories for years, the data has been hidden somewhere on their PCs in not-machine-readable formats.</p><p>From this year, we’re developing a Data Specialists Working Group composed of civic hackers; technitians, designers, and data experts. This group will be in partnerships with NPO, NGO, and the media for data journalism projects. CodeNamu civic technitians and our partners composed of journalists and activits will make synergy to make those data open and to make various data journalism projects between CodeNamu’s civic tech and partners’ insight or messages. We hope that we’re going to introduce and discuss about the way to extend civic tech to outside civic tech community.</p>"

I'm going to share a story about a much longer game, where the payoff is just starting to happen now, five years later.</p><p>This will be a story of how organizations around the world built a software stack for legislative monitoring. It starts with a vision shared in Warsaw in 2011. In 2012, work on a standard data interchange format begins, which will tie the stack together. Two organizations start authoring backend data management tools in 2013 using this format. In 2014, the first user-facing tools appear at the top of this stack. And in 2015, governments begin adopting the data standard, as more user-facing tools spread.</p><p>This journey will visit many organizations and projects around the world, from mySociety to OpenAustralia to Sunlight, and from PopIt to Councilmatic to Represent, among others. We're five years into this journey, and there's still more ground to cover for at least as many more years before the basic problems in legislative monitoring that we're solving can be taken for granted.</p><p>This talk ties into the fork-merge theme.

            "abstract": "<p>From the point of view of urban governance, Nepal’s towns and cities have expanded rapidly. The Kathmandu Valley has grown especially rapidly – from a population of about 1.6 million in 2001 to a population of about 2.5 million in 2011. This unexpected and unplanned growth has proven a challenge to many aspects of city life. The systems by which residents communicate, organize themselves, and negotiate with each other and the state has altered. When the intention is to radically reform the system, large amounts of money and manpower must be gathered. At the same time, there are few initiatives as well who take the opposite approach. New belief is that limited resources and focus also be sufficient in order to begin to dent the system as much as possible on basis of collaborations and crowdsourcing even though there are no single and known solutions to the complex issues of urban governance and no guarantee that any given intervention will succeed.</p><p>GalliGalli is an initiative based in Kathmandu which gathers, packages, and disseminates information using new technologies for the civilians to make their lives easier by providing information on processes – formal and informal – for accessing government services. GalliGalli works both on-the-ground and online. GalliGalli’s core focus is to use open source approach to enable people to take part in social change by facilitating mass participation. This paper would like to explain how these processes and practices are developed and experimented by GalliGalli  using technologies to promote government transparency and attract civic participation through crowdsourcing on different topics which aims to bridge citizen-state gap into daily governance. </p><p>This paper will focus on ‘Nalibeli’ platform developed in Kathmandu to support state-citizens interaction as service providers-and-receivers. For example, when people want to start a business or non-profit, they have to register at the concerned government offices. Subsequently, there are periodic obligations such as submitting annual reports, filing tax returns, and calling general meeting. ‘Nalibeli’ plays a role of consultant to equip people with all the necessary information to fulfill these obligations. Not only through online open technology, a group of young volunteers also visit the concerned offices and guide people through each of the steps if they require support. ‘Nalibeli’ also perform Service Delivery Mapping which is an on-the-ground survey, research, and mapping initiative to document the nature of day-to-day problems faced by citizens, creating a listing of service providers by locality, understand the manner in which neighbourhoods organize. Most of these information are made available through an open platform (<a href='www.nalibeli.org'>www.nalibeli.org</a>) with step-by-step information on how to access a range of government services.

LocalWiki is using OSM for visualizing geographic objects, e.g., a restaurant, a plaza, or an old tree. However, the geographic objects visualized on LocalWiki aren’t interlinked to OSM. The users of LocalWiki actually draw the geographic objects but don’t take geographic objects from OSM. In addition, the geographic objects drawn on LocalWiki aren’t stored in OSM. This project undertakes the improvement of LocalWiki for working together with OSM. The improved LocalWiki will provide a function that users can directly select geographic objects form OSM. As a result, a geographic object textually described LocalWiki can be correspondingly linked to its geographic information on OSM.</p><p>In recent years, OSM often plays an important role in disaster relief. This is because OSM can provide users to map the areas influenced by disaster. In contrast, OSM also allows mappers to contribute the geographic objects associated with disasters such as shelters before a disaster happens. The mapping is a kind of disaster preparedness that is beneficial for mitigating the impact of a coming disaster. The improved LocalWiki will be used for citizens to provide disaster preparedness information and map the information in community level.</p>"

This friction stops people from creating, sharing, collaborating, and using data - especially among distributed communities. Open Knowledge, in working with researchers and government for more than a decade on these issues, have identified a specific area where this friction can be addressed: the technical process of preparing and sharing data. Toward this end, we are developing a lightweight specification and associated tooling for “packaging” data and transporting it easily and efficiently. The approach is titled “Data Package” because our work has a close analogy with “containerization” in shipping and “packaging” in software. Our goal is to make it easy for data go from one person’s tool (e.g. Excel) to another person’s tool as quickly and as easily as possible.</p><p>Through this approach, we think we can reduce friction enough to revolutionize how the open data ecosystem operates with massively improved data quality, utilization and sharing.</p>"

We support 5 of the most popular programming languages so you can write your scraper in the language you know and love. Your scraper runs in the cloud to your schedule and emails you if there are any problems. You can then download your data in CSV or even do SQL queries using the simple API.</p><p>In this talk I will introduce morph.io and show you how everything works behind the scenes. We will then explore some of the thousands of existing scrapers and I'll show you how you can access the tens of millions of rows of data they've already collected.
