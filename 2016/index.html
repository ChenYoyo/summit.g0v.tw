        <h3>About g0v.tw</h3>
        <p>
          g0v is a civic tech community established in late 2012 with deep open-source roots. With 1,000+ contributors through 30+ hackathons, it is recognized as one of the largest group in the global civic tech community.  The results are various civic-made tools for better information disclosure, citizen engagement, and online democracy.  Since the 2014 Summit, we’ve seen increasing collaboration between the civic tech communities in Taiwan, government agencies, media, and NGOs. People from all kinds of organizations have brought valuable data and thoughts into these collaborations. In turn, they often return with new ideas inspired by the open culture.

        <h3>After g0v summit 2014</h3>
        <div class="highlights">
          <p>
            Here are some highlights:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>During the dust explosion accident, the civic tech community mobilized and work with the official emergency response team to provide timely information, and started digital disaster response drills.</li>
            <li>The NGO alliance for constitution reform proposed several projects in the hackathon for people to better understand the issue.</li>
            <li>Minister Tsai, who spoke at the last summit, proposed a consultation platform focused on digital regulations in a hackathon which turned into the vtaiwan platform [link to story]. A framework for evaluating online democracy tool called "blulu" is also emerging.</li>
            <li>Taiwan topped the OKFN Open Data Index in 2015.  Besides vibrant community pushing for more data to be released, one of the main reasons is the open-definition compliant Open Government Data License enacted, which was drafted in the community.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We expect to bring together 750 people next year, with a good mix of public servants, technologists, and NGOs.
